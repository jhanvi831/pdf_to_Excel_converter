"# pdf_to_Excel_converter" 

This code helps convert a pdf file to an excel sheet.
Unlike most of the converters this can convert NON-Tabular data to Excel sheet.

You will have to change a part of the code for different types of pdfs. 
You'll need to know what data is to be extracted from the pdf.

Understanding how Python RegEx Module works will help.
I took help from w3schools.com
